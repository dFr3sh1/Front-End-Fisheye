# FishEye Project

In the frame of my training Design and Developemnt front-end of websites and Applications in REACT and Javascript.

In this project I have to develop a website for photographers to help them to promote their job.

I received a folder which included a technical sheet, some medias (photos and videos), a json file with the data of photographers, index.html and photographer.hml files, style.css and photograpers.css files, index.js, photographer.js and contactForm.js files, and a template in django photographer.js, and the expected outcomes to deliver.

- Homepage
    - List of photographers: names, slogan, location, tarif per hour, and thumbnail image of their choice.
    - When user click on the photographe info it must be redirected to the photographer's space.

- Photographer's space
    - A gallery of their work(photos and videos)
    - A thumbnail for videos on the gallery
    - Like button for each media and likes counter
    - Display the total of likes(addition of likes globally) of the photographe
    - Medias can be organized by popularity or name
    - When user clickes on the medias it must be opened in a lightbox
        - When the lighbox is opened it must be close with the close btn
        - The lightbox must be surfed with navigation btns
    - Contact btn
        - A form that must be displayed over the current page

## Access

The site must respect the WCAG convention and ARIA attributs

## Technologies

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - Django

 Given that I must take the role of the developer and I have the right to implement what I consider necessary to make the code better structured I've decided to install SASS,
 and follow the SMACSS and BEM convention.
